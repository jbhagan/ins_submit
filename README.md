CRDS Submission tool for INS scientists
=======================================

This site uses Django, a Python package for web development.  Django has a
bit of a learning curve, and some of the tutorials just dive in without
giving you the Big Picture of what the package is doing for you.  One of
the best explanations I've seen is in the Mozilla Django tutorial, especially
this section: [What does Django code look like?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Introduction#What_does_Django_code_look_like).
Otherwise, I used tutorials by Corey Schafer, of which [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmljXZIypDc) is the first.
